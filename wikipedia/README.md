## Wikipedia is great!  

Did you know that there is a comparison page for different programming languages?
It's located at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages  
(You can find an offline snapshot of this page inside this directory.)

Wouldn't it be nice to query this data and answer questions like this?

* Which programming languages support more the one programming paradigm (e.g. imperative and functional)?
* Give me all event-driven languages which are standardized.
* Which scripting languages support concurrent execution?

Write a tool which scrapes the above page and can answer these questions.  
The output format and the query language is completely up to you.
