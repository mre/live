Live programming / workshop material.

## Contributing

If you want to submit your solution to one of the tasks, that's easy!  
Just put your solution into a `solutions` subfolder inside each task.  
E.g. `wikipedia/solutions/projectname`.
After that create a pull request. Your solution doesn't need to be perfect.  
It can also be a prototype you want to get feedback on. I'd be happy to do a peer review.
