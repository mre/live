![cat](cat.jpg)

`cat` is a tool to concatenate files (hence the name).  
Mostly it is used to output file contents on a terminal, though.  

Given a text file names `shakespeare.txt` from the local directory,  
write an implementation of `cat` that prints the file contents on the screen.  

Bonus points if you make it fast!
